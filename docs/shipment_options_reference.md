## Core Escrow Fields

### `milestone_mode: MilestoneMode`

**Type:** Enum (`Sequential` | `Parallel`)  
**Default:** `Parallel`

Controls whether milestones must be completed in order or can be completed independently.

- **`Sequential`**: Milestones must be confirmed in order (0 → 1 → 2...). A milestone cannot be confirmed until all previous milestones are confirmed.
- **`Parallel`**: Milestones can be confirmed in any order.

**Use case:** Sequential for staged deliveries, Parallel for independent work streams.

---

### `holdback_ledgers: u32`

**Type:** `u32` (ledger count)  
**Default:** `0`

Number of ledgers to hold payment after milestone confirmation before releasing funds to the supplier.

- **`0`**: Immediate release upon confirmation.
- **`> 0`**: Payment is held for the specified number of ledgers after confirmation.

**Use case:** Quality inspection periods, dispute window enforcement.

---

### `supplier_collateral: i128`

**Type:** `i128` (token amount)  
**Default:** `0`

Amount of collateral the supplier must lock when the shipment is created. Collateral is returned upon successful completion or slashed on supplier-caused cancellation.

**Use case:** Performance bonds, skin-in-the-game for high-value shipments.

---

### `expires_at_ledger: Option<u32>`

**Type:** `Option<u32>` (ledger sequence)

Optional expiry ledger. If set and the current ledger exceeds this value, the shipment is marked `Expired` and funds are refunded to the buyer.

**Use case:** Time-sensitive contracts, regulatory compliance.

---

## Dispute & Resolution

### `dispute_bond_amount: i128`

**Type:** `i128` (token amount)  
**Default:** `0`

- **`> 0`**: Bond scales with shipment value.

**Example:** `dispute_bond_bps = 100` (1%) on a 1M shipment adds 10K to the bond.

## Summary

The `ShipmentOptions` struct provides granular control over escrow behavior, dispute handling, payment flows, and advanced features. Understanding each field allows you to tailor ChainSettle shipments to your specific trade agreements, regulatory requirements, and risk management strategies.
